### Arduino codes for triggering an injector.

These codes were used to operate a Model PLI-100A Pico-Injector.

TTL_low.ino: This code is meant to STOP the Arduino if a code is running and you would like it to not send another signal.

TTL_pulse_train_delay.ino: This code is meant to START the Arduino. Code can be modified to change the number of signals sent, the length of the signal, and time between the signals.
